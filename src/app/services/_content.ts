		description: "Have you changed careers, reprioritized your work/life balance, or retired? Even positive changes are stressful, and can be difficult to navigate on your own. You may be struggling to manage long-term changes such as life goals, aging, health, family, or relationships. Or the changes may be sudden, and painful; the death of a loved one, the death of a pet, the loss of mobility or independence . Whatever changes you are going through can impact your ability to find meaning, a sense of purpose, or hope in your life. Therapy can help you rediscover your strengths and your drive."

		description: "Chronic illness, terminal illness, disability, or pain can change your relationships with others and with yourself. Whether you are caring for a loved one or find yourself needing care, the stress of changed roles and expectations can be overwhelming. As a caregiver you may experience burnout, which reduces your ability to care for yourself and your loved one. As a care recipient you may feel guilt, worry, or anger are eroding your relationship with your caregiver. Therapy can help you make the most of your abilities."

		title: "Depression or Anxiety",
		description: "Everyone feels down or worried at times. Anxiety can cause worries to be intrusive, diminish your ability to focus or concentrate, and make you doubt your decisions. Depression can cause a lack of motivation, a sense of hopelessness, a feeling that things can never get better. Any overwhelming emotion can bring thoughts that you might be better off dead, suicidal ideation, or wishes to end it all. If your mood is getting in the way of you living your life the way you want to, therapy can help."
