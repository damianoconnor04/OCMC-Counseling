		description: "Just as every person is different, every person’s experience of therapy is different. What you bring to therapy is your strengths, skills, goals, and unique view of the world. I help you to recognize patterns, contradictions, beliefs, and behaviors that are currently blocking those strengths, skills, and goals. My approach is pragmatic, focused on the here and now, and building toward the future."

		title: "What to Expect in Therapy Sessions",
		description: "The initial visit, or intake, will be focused on helping me to understand the issue that brings you to therapy, what your hopes are, and what barriers there are to achieving your goals. I will explain the logistics of our work together, any diagnoses we are working with, and form a plan of treatment. Sometimes this can take two or three visits.  As we work together, you will always have some small step in your goal to focus on between sessions; perhaps tracking thoughts and feelings, or trying some new coping skill. During this phase we will usually meet weekly. Over some weeks or months you will find that you are more and more able to create and complete these goals on your own. At this point visits will be reduced to biweekly or monthly, then ended. You are always welcome to return to therapy if your situation changes or you find you need more support."

		description: "I have a Master’s Degree in Counseling Psychology, and am licensed to practice psychotherapy in Pennsylvania. I practice Humanistic, Solution Focused, and Client-Centered Counseling. Before becoming an individual therapist in Pennsylvania, I worked in developing and delivering community and mental health services for older adults in Arizona. Throughout my career I have worked closely with older adults, caregivers, victims of intimate partner violence, members of the disability community, and residents in long term care. I have worked in elder abuse prevention and suicide prevention. I have lived experience with chronic illness, disability, suicide, and am a member of the LGBTQ+ community. I bring all this professional and personal experience to my practice."
